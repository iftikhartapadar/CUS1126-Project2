Explanation of Solution:

In the solution, we used the stack data structure to achieve our solution.
To reverse every single word, we stored each letter in a char variable. We then used the
isWhiteSpace method to help separate the characters from white space - making it a word. When we
were able to have words stored, we used the .pop method to print every single word in reverse
while maintaining word order,

To reverse the whole sentence was a more simple task. We stored the letters from the user input.
This includes whitespace. From that point, we used a loop to iterate and use the .pop method to print.
This produced the reversed sentence.
